# CSE-5368-Neural-Networks
This repository contains the assignments that I did when I took CSE 5368 under Dr. Farhad A Kamangar at UTA in Fall 2022.

Assignment - 01 Implementing Model and Training.

Assignment - 02 Implemented a single layer neural network and used different learning rules to train the network like the unsupervised hebb rule, filtered learning and the delta learning rule.

Assignment - 03 Implemented a class which can be used to create multi-layer neural networks.

Assignment - 04 Implemented a class which can be used to create a CNN or modify existing models.
